	The Space Program was founded in 1958 with the goal of shooting as many
	things into space as possible. It all started with some unmanned
	satellites, but soon we were sending all sorts of things up there -
	monkeys, dogs, and eventually even people.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In the
	late 1960s, The Space Program accomplished its crowning moment by
	landing a man on the moon. At that point, it was imagined that soon,
	travel to other planets, and even other solar systems would be
	happening in just a few short years, but we were mistaken.<br />
	&nbsp;<br /> Since then, The Space Program has sent many unmanned
	vessels all over the galaxy, and established a space station orbiting
	the earth. We've landed robots on Mars, and used telescopes to peer
	into distant galaxies.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> What happens next? In the
	next ten years we hope to build a moon base and begin plans to send men
	to Mars. We would say that the sky is the limit, but we've gone far
	beyond the sky.
